# BigDataForHealth

### General setup
1. Use Conda to set up a virtual environment and install all the required packages, including Torch, TorchVision, OpenCV, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, PySpark, PIL, sklearn, etc
2. Use Ubuntu. Windows or Mac could cause problems

### To generate preprocessed images
1. Make sure that the `CheXpert-v1.0-small` folder is in the root directory of the repository
2. Run `python preprocess.py`  to generate all cropped frontal images. The cropped image is named as `temp` + the original file name and is stored at the same directory as the original image

### To test the model
1. Replace the model path with the model paths you want to compare. By default, it compares the Densenet model and the Resnet model
1. Run `python test.py`

###To generate a heatmap
1. Replace `input_image` with the path to the image that you want to generate a heatmap for
2. Replace path_to_model with the path to the model you want to use. So far it only works for DenseNet
